Resume
======

Below is a short list of the more notable aspects of my career. If you're
curious what I can do, ask me to do it!

Education
---------

I read a lot, and my colleagues are nice enough to impart knowledge upon me
where they have it.

A (non-exhaustive) list of the books I've read):

- "How Google Works" - Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg
- "Packet Guide to Core Network Protocols" - Bruce Hartpence
- "Site Reliability Engineering" - Betsy Beyer
- "Continuous Delivery" - Jez Humble & David Farley
- "Building Microservices" - Sam Newman
- "Hacking - The Next Generation" - Nitesh Dhanjani
- "Web Performance Daybook" - Stoyan Stefanov
- "High Performance Web Sites" - Steve Souders
- "High Performance Browser Networking" - Illya Grigorik

Competencies
------------

Predominently, I have quite a bit of experience with Magento, and am passionate
about performance, user interface and, to a lesser extent, security.

I keep [a lot of notes](https://docs.littleman.co/) which are a reasonable
indication of my competency and interest. Generated by Hugo, deployed via
Travis to a Kubernetes cluster.

Languages
'''''''''

I'm pretty sure I could hack around in another language reasonably quickly; it
might take me a couple of years to feel at home in it, though.

Current Employment
------------------

Full time developer at Fontis, PTY LTD.

Employment History
------------------

3/10/14 - Present; Fontis, PTY LTD
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Developer, specializing in the LEMP stack.

1/3/14 - 1/10/14 - Shop At, PTY LTD
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Developer, developing a custom Magento based platform for multiple buyers and
sellers to showcase their wares. The company was a start up, and ran out of
funding.

Notable Work
------------

Just about all work has been collaborative, and I cannot take all credit for
anything I've been involved with. However, some of the more notable projects
I'm happiest with are:

Port the MageAudit Magento analysis tool from Laravel 2 to Magento 1.x
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Most of the analysis existed, however the initial design had some inefficient
designs, and the opportunity was taken to restructure the design to make
additional analysis far easier to implement in future.

Implementation if automated lints as part of the normal code review process
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Now part of the standard workflow, lints are run as part of code review, and
issues highlighted (and generally solved) before a human reviwer inspects the
work. This reduces the nitpicking associated with code review, and provides some
clear standards for code style to follow.

Implemented lints are:

- PHP
- PHPCS
- scss-lint
- Spelling
- Git Merge
- File Permissions

Implementation of lints on git commit, that prevent commit unless lints pass
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

In order to keep my own code as clean as possible, all the repos I work with
run the lints over all files that have changed. If the lints are violated
the violations are displayed in the terminal, and the commit cancelled.

The lints can be skipped by ensuring the environment variable "SKIP_LINTS"
exists. However, to ensure I don't become lazy, a large warning notice is
shown, and the commit is paused for 5 seconds.

You can see this `git hook on GitHub`_

Redesign of the GAZ MAN website
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The design for the desktop site was kept as similar as possible to the current
design, but the design was ported to bootstrap 3.x and made responsive.

Redesign of the Bing Lee checkout
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

A complete reimplementation of a one step checkout, requiring as little
information from the user as is required by the other information
specified during the checkout.

This required considerable restructuring of Magento's core validation logic,
additional validation and reasonably complex implementation of various
JavaScript driven features.

Provisioning of a Kubernetes cluster on CoreOS
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Still ongoing, but the goal is to have a Kubernetes stack that can be run on
anything from bare metal to a cloud provider.

Highlights of this were:

- Creating several systemd units with various dependencies to manage the boot
  process.
- The need to drain the node as part of the CoreOS upgrade/reboot process
