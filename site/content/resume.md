# Resume

Continually in progress. Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately?) I have a job
I enjoy, and am not particularly inclined to write a resume. However, below are
some things that came to mind.

## Education
Entirely on the job. I got my first professional development job after
experiencing some disaster running my own personal fitness training business,
and I have been faking it ever since.

## Competencies
If you're curious about the level of knowledge I have, check out
[my notes](https://docs.littleman.co/). They're visible as they're nicer to read
that way, and since it's deployed by Travis CI onto Kubernetes, updating them
is effortless.

### Languages
I'm pretty sure I could hack around in another language reasonably quickly; it
might take me a couple of years to feel at home in it, though.

- 7/10 PHP
- 6/10 JavaScript
- 8/10 SCSS/CSS
- 5/10 Bash, Shell
- 1/10 Go (I'm ambitious here, but haven't found anything to use Go for)
- 6/10 English
- 3/10 German
- 1/10 Japanese

### Environments
- 6/10 Linux (Debian, Arch & Ubuntu. Also, there's just so much to Linux! I'll
  never know it all)
- 5/10 Windows (I don't use it at all anymore, save for playing games)
- 6/10 Kubernetes
- 7/10 Docker

### Tools
- 7/10 Intellij IDEs (PHPStorm)
- 7/10 Git

## Work Situation
I work at Fontis, a specialist Magento development company in Australia as a
general Magento developer. My entire professional life has centered around
Magento!

## Notable Work
It's hard to point to things and say "There's something I did", as almost all of
the work I do is collaborative, and to take credit would be to do a disservice
to the other members of the teams I work with.

However, I can say "Here are some of the projects I've been involved with, that
I'm particularly happy with"

### Port the MageAudit Magento analysis tool from Laravel 2 to Magento 1.x
Most of the analysis existed, however the initial design had some inefficient
designs, and the opportunity was taken to restructure the design to make
additional analysis far easier to implement in future.

### Implementation if automated lints as part of the normal code review process
While still in its trial period, and more generally a proof of concept the PHPCS
lint is now a standard automated machine code review that takes place prior to
human code review.

## References
I could probably ask some people if they're OK to tell you what they think of
me. I have never asked before!
