Conventions
===========

I try to reuse the same symbols, to mean the same things. Below are what various
symbols mean.

*italic*
--------

Indicates new terms, URLs, email addresses, filenames or extensions

`constant width`
----------------

Used for program listings, as well as within paragraphs to
refer to program elements such as variable or method names, databases, data
types, environment variables, statements and keywords.

Also refers to commands that might be literally typed by the user.

{Placeholder}
-------------

Refers to text that should be supplied with user supplied values, or other
values determined by the context.

Tips
----

Containers that communicate:

.. container:: tip idea

  An idea, or helpful note

.. container:: tip warning

  Something to be wary of

.. container:: tip error

  Something that is dangerous

.. container:: tip info

  Additional, supplementary information such as definitions.

Footnote [#f1]_
