= Switch from Jenkins CI to Circle CI 

The existing CI/CD tooling was based on a self hosted Jenkins server hosted on "bare metal" servers and had become
a tangled mess aggregating various git repositories into a build pipeline that few people understood or could debug.
The Jenkins setup was deemed to great an operational overhead and I volunteered to do the necessary investigation and
migration plan to a new CI service. CircleCI was chosen as it allowed a version controlled, docker driven flow but
did not have the maintenance burden associated with hosting CI tooling as well it was understandable from all members
of the development team. The goal with the migration was to allow the team to take more responsibility for the build
and delivery process allowing the DevOps team to focus on more specialised work. In conjunction with team members I
implemented lints and tests, and had started implementing a new release process when the project was terminated.
