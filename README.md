This is my personal website. It's open as if you're trying to get an understanding of my competencies, it's probably
useful to see exactly how I construct things (particularly things of little consequence, such as a personal website).

If you're curious about why something is like it is, let me know. I've rebuilt this website quite a few times, as it
tends to be how I experiment with upcoming technologies.

## Brand

There are various things that I try to keep consistent throughout my various internet properties. I have found that
it's useful to retain identity across different contexts, such as Twitter, Github, Conferences, Meetups etc.

### Colours
