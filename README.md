This is my personal website. It's open as if you're trying to get an
understanding of my competencies, it's probably useful to see exactly how I
construct things (particularly things of little consequence, such as a personal
website).

If you're curious about why something is like it is, let me know. I've rebuilt
this website quite a few times, as it tends to be how I experiment with
upcoming technologies (for example, Bootstrap 4).
